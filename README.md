## Usage
*Note that you must have node (and npm) installed.*

Install the npm package from the root directory through:

Once installed, simply add the following import in your styles.scss, and you are good to go: 

```
@use '~@daimler/productkit-angular/src/theme/scss/styles';
```

Or use the following instead:

```
@import '~@daimler/productkit-angular/src/theme/scss/styles';
```

Note: If your project already has styling or uses prebuilt-themes please update the angular.json 
and styling files to use styles from Product Kit for Angular.
